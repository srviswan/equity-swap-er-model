   - `PartyRole`: Party roles and responsibilities

5. **Events & Observations**
   - `TradeEvent`: Lifecycle events (execution, confirmation, termination)
   - `ObservationEvent`: Price observations and market data

6. **Risk & Valuation**
   - `Valuation`: Mark-to-market valuations and risk metrics

7. **Settlement & Collateral**

## Supported Equity Swap Types

### 1. **Price Return Swaps**
- Focus on equity price appreciation/depreciation
- No dividend pass-through
- Suitable for pure price exposure strategies

### 2. **Total Return Swaps**
- Includes both price performance and dividend returns
- Complete economic exposure to underlying equity
- Most common equity swap structure

### 3. **Variance Swaps**
- Settlement based on realized variance of underlying
- Requires daily price observations
- Used for volatility trading strategies

### 4. **Volatility Swaps**
- Settlement based on realized volatility (square root of variance)
- Popular for volatility arbitrage strategies

## Business Process Coverage

### Trade Lifecycle
1. **Trade Execution**: Initial trade capture and validation
2. **Confirmation**: Trade confirmation and legal documentation
3. **Observation**: Daily price observations and market data capture
4. **Valuation**: Regular mark-to-market and risk calculations
5. **Reset Events**: Periodic performance resets and settlements
6. **Settlement**: Cash flow calculations and payment processing
7. **Termination**: Trade closure and final settlements

### Risk Management
- **Market Risk**: Delta, gamma, vega, and theta calculations
- **Credit Risk**: Counterparty exposure and collateral management
- **Operational Risk**: Data quality controls and audit trails
